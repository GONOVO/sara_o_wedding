      "She went over and above to make sure we felt comfortable and confident in all of the decisions we made, never pressured us in any way, was extremely time-oriented and organized, and brought her own creativity and design talents to the process. If you want a planner who is always one step ahead of you, look no further! Also, we were extremely impressed with Sara O Events as a whole as they have very professional systems and relationships in place, which added to the reliability and efficiency of the entire process. Forever grateful for Sara O Events!",

      "I would give Sara O Events a 10-star rating for the wedding planning and support services they provided to our family if it were possible. Yewenda was the linchpin in making Chidera and Yinka’s wedding beautiful, flawless in scheduling and execution, super fun, and truly memorable. No detail escaped her attention. She is a consummate professional who is also a joy to work with warm, accommodating, flexible, timely, extremely well-organized, and endlessly gracious. I could not recommend Sara O Events more highly.",

      "Yewenda just got the vibe Yele and I were going for she wasn’t just our planner, but a true creative partner. The ideas poured out of her effortlessly! The questions she asked to understand our taste weren’t generic - they were so thoughtful, and if I randomly referenced some obscure fabric or boutique hotel design? She immediately knew what I meant. She understood us so intuitively, I almost wondered if we’d been friends in a past life! Now that it’s all over? We genuinely miss her. That’s how incredible she is.",
