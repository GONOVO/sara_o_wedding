      "Erica and Bianca are an incredible joy to work with. They were able to make all of our dreams come true and beyond. The work they put in pre-wedding is meticulously organized and curated to the couple. During the wedding events, them and their team take care of it ALL. We were fully able to enjoy our weekend without worrying about a thing. They make it all happen better than you imagined. Erica and Bianca have the best vendor recommendations and create your dream wedding team. You cannot have better people in your corner throughout this journey.",

      "They went over and above to make sure we felt comfortable and confident in all of the decisions we made, never pressured us in any way, were extremely time-oriented and organized, and brought their own creativity and design talents to the process.  If you want a planner who is always one step ahead of you, look no further! Also, we were extremely impressed with Estera Events as a whole as they have very professional systems and relationships in place, which added to the reliability and efficiency of the entire process. Forever grateful for Estera!",

      "I would give Estera Events a 10-star rating for the wedding planning and support services they provided to our family if it were possible. They were the linchpin in making Molly and Shai's wedding beautiful, flawless in scheduling and execution, super fun, and truly memorable. No detail escaped their attention. They are consummate professionals who are a joy personally to work with - warm, accommodating, flexible, timely, extremely well organized, and gracious. I could not recommend Estera Events more highly.",

      "They understood the vibe Jim and I were going for, and were such great creative partners – the ideas just flow from them! The questions they asked us to get an understanding of our taste were not run of the mill but poignant, and if I made an obscure reference to a certain fabric or hotel design – they always knew exactly what I was talking about. They understood us from the jump in such a way that I wondered if we were friends in pre-school or something!",
