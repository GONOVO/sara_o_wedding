The questions she asked to understand our taste weren’t generic - they were so thoughtful, and if I randomly referenced some obscure fabric or boutique hotel design? She immediately knew what I meant. She understood us so intuitively, I almost wondered if we’d been friends in a past life! Now that it’s all over? We genuinely miss her. That’s how incredible she is.",
